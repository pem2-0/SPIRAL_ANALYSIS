# SPIRAL_ANALYSIS
Spiral Analysis is a recursive diagnostic framework for detecting spiral suppression signatures in full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. It tests the hypothesis that the early universe contains harmonic imprints—specifically logarithmic spiral paths governed by the golden ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) and √7
